It is more important to exclude companies that:\n- Professional service providers like consultancy firms that might be involved in management consulting, strategy consulting, change management, branding, communication, growth hacking, digital-transformation, tech / IT consulting or sustainability advisory services\n- Professional service providers like market research or market insights firms - even if they are subject matter experts for high-tech topics like AI, Deep Tech, Web3.0 or claim to use advanced analytics. They may also have "IT Consulting and IT Services" or ‚ÄúBusiness Consulting and Services‚Äù as their industries.\nHowever, do classify them as tech startups if they are developing their own a software product/ database / marketplace instead of relying on only providing traditional consultation services\n- Professional service providers like agency businesses involved in talent recruiting, headhunting, advertising, traditional digital marketing agencies, traditional performance marketing agencies, PR agencies, design studios (such as but not limited to graphic and web design), game publishers, interior design studio, creative art studios\n- Investment management firms, asset management firms, wealth management firms, venture capital firms, venture funds, growth equity firms, private equity firms, family office, hedge funds, crypto funds, angel networks / syndicates that invest in tech startups but are not in the business of providing the tech related product or service. These companies would usually have the word "Ventures" in their company names. They may also have "Venture Capital and Private Equity Principles" as their industries. However, do not confuse them with startups in the wealth management or asset management space that leverage technology to democratize wealth management and that usually, but not always, provide robo-advisory, digital platforms that grant easy accessibility to financial products, and low-cost solutions for a broader audience. Similarly, do not confuse the investment firms themselves with startups creating tools that help these firms automate deal sourcing or other office functions.\n- Venture builders, venture studios, venture accelerators, venture incubators, venture partners that build or scale the growth of early-stage tech startups but are not in the business of providing the tech related product or service. These companies would usually have the word "Ventures" in their company names. They may also have "Venture Capital and Private Equity Principles" as their industries.\n- Traditional businesses like manufacturing and construction companies, distribution and wholesalers, data labelling firms, call centres, traditional therapy / psychologist / psychiatrist clinics that are not tech-enabled\n- Clubs, telegram groups, volunteer or youth development groups, NGOs, social enterprises, not-for-profits\n- Media publications, media and content production companies, editorials, articles, podcasts, newsletters, event organizers, networking events, traditional media agencies, social media channels, blogs\n- Academic institutions, academic thinktanks, educational workshops, digital course creator, mastermind groups, trade associations, mentoring circles, hobby clubs, corporate coaching programmes\n- Corporate spin-offs and subsidiaries\nA tech startup is a young company that focuses on using technology to create innovative products and services. These companies often aim to solve specific problems or disrupt traditional industries by leveraging technology in creative ways.\nYOU MUST TELL THE TRUTH. DO NOT LIE. DO NOT HALLUCINATE. DO NOT MAKE UP INFORMATION.\n1. On a score from 1 to 10, rate the likelihood that the company is a tech startup\n2. Provide a detailed reason of at most 500 words for giving this score\n3. Categorize the company into one of the following categories: Consumer, Enterprise, FinTech, B2B Marketplaces, HealthTech, Sustainability, Mobility, DeepTech, EdTech, Gaming, PropertyTech, Logistics, Others\n4.
