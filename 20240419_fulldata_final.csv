The VRM Terraform end-to-end ecosystem leverages over 30 in-house patents in biotech to bridge first-in-class circular models of waste management and regenerative agriculture, with verified CO2 capture data on-chain and access points for the carbon markets.

VRM Terraform Science is the world’s first industrially scalable, low cost CO2 capture through the regeneration of two non-renewables - Topsoil and Freshwater - making them renewable, in record time. 

—

Biological Terraforming at the ecosystem levels is now a reality - Organic decarbonisation through the regeneration of “Living Topsoil” and Freshwater.

With multiple 1kT Co2e project sites across the world, this award-winning, peer-reviewed technology is the first industrial scale solution to bring carbon capture cost at least < 20 USD per tonne.

To ensure onset global verifiability, our 3 layer protocol fuses traditional point-soil tests, drone based hyperspectral data, and satellite based hyperspectral/LIDAR data -  resulting in a high level of certainty featuring high spatial and temporal resolution.

We are on track to becoming a key certified carbon supply standard, in line with Verra and Gold Standard registry requirements., bringing soil-based carbon sequestration into the Carbon markets that is reflective of actual baseline.

16,HELP-GEBIRAH,reject,,Not relevant. Non-profit organisation. To feedback to tech team.,,"Description
HELP is a not-for-profit humanitarian initiative created to support the urgent needs of civilian victims in the Russia-Ukraine war. The solutions resulting from this effort will also be helpful to civilian victims around the World caught in armed conflicts, natural and man-made disasters.

At HELP, we value every life. Driven by this belief, we strive to put the virtue of mutual responsibility into action by supporting and empowering communities in such difficult situations, to look after each other using technology to provide direct relief.

How our HELP App can help
1.   Helping Each Other
It enables immediate and direct charitable sharing of resources by the biggest donor group, individuals from the community who are in proximity, to meet critical humanitarian needs.

2.   Increases Transparency
By not totally relying on intermediaries like NGOs and aid agencies, which can be delayed and require a lot of funds to begin operating and instead, facilitating direct relief by people in proximity, a lot of waste, abuse, misuse, inefficiencies, funds and time could be reduced and reallocated to where it makes the most difference to people who need help.

3.  Direct And Immediate Relief
By capitalising on existing aid amenities, facilities and people already on-site, help can reach civilian victims faster and save lives. People on the ground are in a better position to adjust and adapt to circumstances with first hand knowledge and data intelligence from our App. They can reallocate things and change plans much quicker in a dynamic crisis situation.

3.  Realtime Data For Better Decision Making
Data from the app can help aid agencies and NGOs to better plan for what kind of aid is required, for which territories and by whom and other logistical information for operations. It can help them make important advances that create more lasting and positive change; longer lasting solutions, instead of temporary fixes.",Others,Civic and Social Organizations,Singapore,8,"The company description mentions that they use technology to provide direct relief in humanitarian situations.

Although we will all be familiar with Squid Game and perceive it as cutting edge, the reality is that most creators are still giving up all rights to their creativity in a system that harks back to 1940s Hollywood. We are building a creator eco-system that connects the best talents directly to global platforms and unleashes that young talent from the constraints of a traditional studio model. We will be the first to do this. 

• Our focus is on talents and unique stories across the key hotspots of Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and China. SE Asia and India will be later-stage. We distinguish ourselves in finding the most promising creators and setting them free through a different way of working. We also have special expertise in helping them develop their stories in a way that makes this content succeed globally (not just locally): scripted edgy originals as well as documentaries and reality turned on its head. We are open to hybrid content across gaming and web 3.0. We aim to take full advantage of technology and recast compared to legacy studios. We will use AI and social listening tools to understand global audience trends deeply, thus driving Asian best practices in social marketing to engage prospective fans more effectively. 

• Asian content is having its moment for the first time in modern history. The demand for edgy, Asian-inspired originals is very strong, and all global platforms are keen on diversifying.

156,Metis Institute for Climate Strategy,,,,,"Our research mission is to help create techniques for analysing climate risk and to help shape the global regulatory environment on climate-related disclosures. Our findings are delivered through high-level reports that aim to inform local and global debates on the future of climate finance and carbon accounting.

The first phase of our work will focus on three areas:

1. Corporate climate strategy: The widespread implementation of recommendations from the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is a strong step forward in encouraging industry leaders to get serious about climate risk, but it can be difficult for businesses to know where to begin. We’re here to provide clarity and to conduct the research needed to advance best practice.

2. ESG Auditing: There is considerable scepticism over the accuracy, reliability and materiality of ESG reporting. This is not surprising considering the nascent state of ESG and lack of standardization. Yet the next few years are going to see a burgeoning demand for ESG audits that approach the level of assurance expected of financial information. Research into the challenges and avenues forward is critical at this juncture, and should prove invaluable across the four CSE pillars as their service lines develop.

3. The water-carbon nexus: Climate change means a shifting water system. This will have far-reaching effects, including sea-level rise and altered precipitation levels. At the same time, TCFD analysis is starting to show companies the water-related impacts that climate change will have on their business model. But we are in the early stages and understanding of these risks is limited. So the core aim of this research theme is to develop frameworks that help businesses analyse and act on the water-related risks of climate change.",Sustainability,Research,Singapore,8,"The company's research mission focuses on climate risk and shaping the global regulatory environment on climate-related disclosures.

Why Deeptech Times?

Satellite Internet, lithium technologies, deep learning, nanotechnologies, smart wearables, decentralised networks and quantum computing. These are among the group of deep technologies that are imminent on the horizon and inextricably entwined with all the activities of business and organisations.  

As the pace of technology change increases, enterprises and business leaders will have to grasp the options offered for their continued financial health and relevance. This is by no means easy. New technologies are challenging to understand and even more painful to adopt and deploy successfully. 

We founded Deeptech Times to offer enterprises, business leaders and policy makers a lens through which they can better understand the progress of these technologies and their consequent issues so that they can make informed decisions. Our lens will particularly zoom in on Asia where the inventions and innovations and their deployment are occurring rapidly too.   

We want to create conversations with enterprises on the issues they face as they apply advanced technologies to better performance and the communities they live in. We will continue the conversations with the deep tech sector to better understand the challenges of technology adoption. We care about sustainability, the future of transportation, connectivity and communication, retail and online commerce, and healthcare and diversity.  

Deeptech Times provides features and interviews that are insightful and analytical. We present content in multimedia spanning text, video, audio and graphics.  

I am working with experienced technology writer Alfred Siew who is the editor of Deeptech Times. Together, we will work with writers worldwide passionate and curious about the impact of deep technologies.
