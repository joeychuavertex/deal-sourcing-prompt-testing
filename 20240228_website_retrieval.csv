We recognize that humans are a part of nature and strongly advocate for a shift away from human-centred thinking and towards eco-centrism, or nature-centred thinking.

Our design approach is Regenerative Lighting Design. Regenerative means creating positive impacts rather than merely minimizing negative ones, and goes beyond ""sustainable"". Applying this philosophy in the context of lighting design means taking for granted conventional lighting design approaches that reduce negative environmental and social impacts, such as energy conservation and light pollution, and creating light environments that actively contribute to the regeneration and enhancement of natural systems, social systems, and economies, including human. A comprehensive design approach is required, taking into account the interrelationships of many conditions and elements. Our Regenerative lighting design principles are integrated with all our design/ consulting services.

82,The Legacy Project,No,Content producer,"[WHO WE ARE]

A collective of creatives who craft autobiography shorts for those who are dying or have died - through photos, film and the written word. 

[WHY WE DO THIS]

Dying is a really hard thing for everyone involved, no matter how you prepare yourself for it. 

The heartbeat of The Legacy Project is to confer honour upon the one who is passing or has passed, by telling the story of their life and the legacy that they leave behind, and to help their loved ones grief and remember the person that they are. 

Think of it as a personal ‚Äúhero story‚Äù or biography short.

We believe that every human life has deep meaning and a legacy that continues to ripple on, but sometimes these are in the unseen elements and simply requires a witness to make it seen. We want to be that witness. 

[HOW WE TELL THE STORIES]

Much like how a biography is approached, interviews will be done with the passing person and/or their close loved ones, which will then be weaved into a written story by the Storyteller. 

Sometimes the real essence of a person is unseen to themselves and those around them, and requires someone to perceive, connect the dots, and make that known. That‚Äôs what the Storytellers will do.

The written stories will be beautifully paired with pictures of them and their loved ones by the Photographers. Who and what we photograph will be dependent on their comfort level and their story, and approached with respectful sensitivity. 

The purpose of the final story is not to simply recount events, but to pull out and witness to who the person is, and the unique essence they embody - their legacy to the earth. 

[RATES]
$900 for a full story.  

Each story includes: 
- a series of at least 50 photos
- a written autobiography short of the individual of at least 20 pages
- a final edited photo story e-book
- unlimited interview sessions with the individual, family and friends",the_legacy_project.vertex_invalid,,,,,

The mentorship is also further enriched by life counselling services provided by its partner, International Minds, enabling even the most lost of mentees, to embark on their journey of discovering themselves.

The programme runs in 3 months cycles, during which mentees are matched to a mentor through a holistic matching process. Throughout their mentorship period, mentees have full access to all supplementary programmes of The Academic Label.

In The Academic Label's initial pilot run between December 2022 and February 2023, the programme accepted 40 over mentees and recruited 30 over mentors. Cumulatively, in the three months of the first run, mentor-mentee pairs completed over 180 hours of mentorship.

The initiative also launched the Application Support Programme, a supplementary programme aimed at guiding mentees through their tertiary education aspirations through team-based support from an incredibly diverse (and continuously growing) team of over 30 advisors representing 10 different locales. 

In upcoming runs, beyond scaling up the mentor and mentee intakes, the programme is expanding the Application Support Programme through school based partnerships. Pilots for programmes aimed at providing vocational experiences for mentees are also underway and are set to be launched in the upcoming runs.

In line with our desire for continuous growth, the initiative's mentor pool and administrative team is constantly growing and actively welcomes all motivated persons.",theacadlabel.com,"The Academic Label offers a 1 to 1 mentorship program along with supplementary programs like application support and career/life coaching, aimed at aiding students in their decision-making process.",The target audience of The Academic Label is youths who are still discovering their academic and career passions.,"The main problem statement of The Academic Label is the difficulty in navigating interests and the pressure to achieve good grades, which they aim to address through mentorship and support programs.",Not enough info,Not enough info

HELP is a not-for-profit humanitarian initiative created to support the urgent needs of civilian victims in the Russia-Ukraine war. The solutions resulting from this effort will also be helpful to civilian victims around the World caught in armed conflicts, natural and man-made disasters.

At HELP, we value every life. Driven by this belief, we strive to put the virtue of mutual responsibility into action by supporting and empowering communities in such difficult situations, to look after each other using technology to provide direct relief.

How our HELP App can help
1.   Helping Each Other
It enables immediate and direct charitable sharing of resources by the biggest donor group, individuals from the community who are in proximity, to meet critical humanitarian needs.

2.   Increases Transparency
By not totally relying on intermediaries like NGOs and aid agencies, which can be delayed and require a lot of funds to begin operating and instead, facilitating direct relief by people in proximity, a lot of waste, abuse, misuse, inefficiencies, funds and time could be reduced and reallocated to where it makes the most difference to people who need help.

3.  Direct And Immediate Relief
By capitalising on existing aid amenities, facilities and people already on-site, help can reach civilian victims faster and save lives. People on the ground are in a better position to adjust and adapt to circumstances with first hand knowledge and data intelligence from our App. They can reallocate things and change plans much quicker in a dynamic crisis situation.

3.  Realtime Data For Better Decision Making
Data from the app can help aid agencies and NGOs to better plan for what kind of aid is required, for which territories and by whom and other logistical information for operations. It can help them make important advances that create more lasting and positive change; longer lasting solutions, instead of temporary fixes.",gebirah.org,"HELP App is a mobile-digital platform that matches requests for humanitarian aid from civilians caught in armed conflict zones or natural disasters with others within proximity who may be willing to meet those requests.
