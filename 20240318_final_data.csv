Your Support Makes Changes Happen

Bhadla Solar

India – Solar

To replace thermal and fossil fuel-based energy, this project installs a 70 MW solar power facility in Bhadla village to harness Rajasthan’s famous sunshine. It reduces the emissions of harmful greenhouse gases, instead exporting clean and renewable energy to the Indian national grid. In doing so, this project will work towards India’s national progressive energy target of reaching 100GW of solar energy capacity by 2022.

Rimba Raya Biodiversity

Indonesia– REDD+

The Rimba Raya project is a REDD+ program aimed at reducing emissions and preserving the environment, which includes the world’s largest privately funded sanctuary for orangutans in collaboration with the Orangutan Foundation International.

The project covers 64,977 hectares of peatland in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. It aims to reduce emissions by over 104,000,000 tCO2e during a 30-year period from July 1st, 2009 to June 30th, 2039.

Improved Cook Stove

Nepal – ICS

The Nepalese communities in the project use traditional cookstoves with 10% efficiency. The distributed improved cookstoves are two models of single-pot rocket stoves, HPNJE-01ND and Greenway Jumbo, with 30.29% and 29.79% efficiency, respectively. VNV Advisory Services has been driving carbon reduction initiatives since 2010, impacting over 6 million rural households in South Asia through various programs, including sustainable agriculture and clean cooking devices.

Plastic Offset

Thailand – Ocean Plastic Recycle

Despite what many people believe, the production of virgin plastic has actually increased to an all-time high. In 2021, the global production of virgin plastic surpassed 380 million tons, which is over double the amount produced 20 years prior, when it was just 200 million tons.

The project goal is to recover and recycle ocean plastic in all islands and coastal areas of Thailand.

What Recruiters Say

“As a sourcer I find Scout to be really helpful. All I need to do is
plug in my job description – it picks out the right keywords
and you get a good talent pool that by manual sourcing you might not
be able to get. The AI feature is accurate - it cuts out my sourcing
time in half!”

Safinaz

In-house talent sourcer

“We been using Scout for months and it’s helped us increase our flow of quality candidates immensely. The search and filter options have allowed us to go from a reactive position of waiting for candidates to apply, to now going on the offense by finding and connecting to candidates that are a match to our requirements.”

Jesper

Start-up founder

“It helps that Scout can recommend someone based on work visa
requirements, and you don’t have to manually scroll through
profiles to find out. You can spend hours and hours on LinkedIn doing
a manual search, but with Scout I cut that time down significantly.”

EJ

Agency Recruiter

“Scout is proving to be a valuable asset in our technology suite. Reduces sourcing time significantly and the new feature for automating tailored outreach is proving a success both internally and with potential candidates.”

Rob Bryson

Agency Managing Director

“Scout spotlighted a profile as a top match, prompting me to reach out
via the email feature. The conversation confirmed that he indeed
possessed the necessary skills as shown by Scout. Given the [lack of]
details on his [LinkedIn] profile, I would have likely missed it using
conventional boolean.”

Accurate

In the complex landscape of sustainable finance, decision-making is only as good as the data that informs it. Our platform sources ESG data from an expansive network of sensors, satellites, and IoT devices. These state-of-the-art technologies enable real-time monitoring with unparalleled precision. From tracking carbon emissions to measuring water quality, our data accuracy eliminates guesswork and sets a new standard for sustainability assessments. This level of accuracy provides Financial Institutions the confidence they need to issue, manage, and invest in sustainable projects.

Automated

Time is money, and in today’s digital age, automation is not a luxury—it’s a necessity. Our platform fully automates the ESG data collection process, freeing your team from the cumbersome manual tracking and self reporting of sustainability metrics. With real-time data sourced directly from sensors and satellites, we offer an always-on, always-updated snapshot of your sustainability performance. This automated streamlining translates to quicker decision-making, reduced overhead, and a more agile response to sustainability challenges and opportunities.

Auditable

Transparency and accountability are paramount in the financial sector, particularly when it comes to the growing field of sustainable finance. Our ESG data isn’t just Accurate and Automated—it’s also Auditable. The rich, granular data we collect provides a comprehensive audit trail, which is indispensable for compliance and reporting requirements. Financial institutions can effortlessly verify the sustainability metrics of their projects, thereby building trust with regulators, investors, and stakeholders alike.

The lack of credible ESG performance data is a huge impediment for impact investors, slowing down the injection of capital in truly deserving projects. AQUILA’s solution using innovative technologies like IoT sensors and AI-driven actionable insights from real-time data equips investors like myself with a useful lens to evaluate and assess our investments

Impact Investor - Vietnam

I strongly believe that integrity is the foundation of all impactful work. Unfortunately, sustainability is often misunderstood and actively misused to obtain capital, improve reputation and attract customers. There needs to be a tool that distinguishes true ESG efforts from greenwashing. I think AQUILA addresses this issue at the core, as real-time data precisely resolves any doubts around credibility of a project

CFO, Energy Company - Singapore

As a private equity investor, I am always on the lookout for due-diligence tools. Lack of a single-source-of-truth for ESG performance makes monitoring investments challenging. At times, we have to make a leap-of-faith, hoping that the investment abides by ESG standards. AQUILA solution is powered by real-time data and directly solves this pain-point with reliable and instant information on portfolio performance

Testimonials

“The Deep-Tech Venture Partners (DTVP) team has proven their ability to build promising deep-tech ventures in Singapore and to crowd in knowledge partners, corporates and investors to deliver maximum value to their portfolio startups. These serve as key votes of confidence for Enterprise Singapore to partner with DTVP, as well as the Singapore Deep-Tech Alliance (SDTA), to build up the deep-tech startup ecosystem in Singapore. DTVP is able to leverage Singapore's ideal ecosystem to invest in promising deep-tech ventures that address highly unmet societal needs by capitalising on scientific breakthroughs and we are confident their experience is an essential factor to a successful exit for deep-tech ventures.”

Ms Sophia Ng, Executive Director, Startup Development Division and SWITCH, Enterprise Singapore.

“I am excited to learn of and have full confidence that Deep-Tech Venture Partners (DTVP) will help deep-tech startups accelerate their product to market and pave the way to a successful exit. It has been a great experience collaborating with the team behind DTVP over the last few years, during which they have designed a structured 9-month venture building programme and skillfully recruited experienced entrepreneurs and individuals from diverse backgrounds with solid business know-how and technical expertise. Not only does the DTVP team have a strong track record in supporting these early-stage ventures, it also has a unique value proposition to fuel the exit for growth stage companies. I look forward to further enhancing and creating deeper synergies with the DTVP team throughout the venture lifecycle.”

Mr. Allen Tan, Deputy Director and Assistant Vice President, A*STAR - Agency for Science, Technology and Research

Our diverse team of domain experts, first principle problem solvers, and constant real-time skill development helps us to create solutions that drive results!

While many celebrate burn rates, funds raised and the glamour of being in the press, we feel most successful businesses are based on unique customer insights and are often ‘boring’ in nature. For example: mailchimp, audiopen, tweethunter and many more.

Value is created when teams are small and frugal. Our DNA is to incubate and invest in start-ups that are built on AI-first principles. That redefines the cost to build, cost of operations, and experiences that truly delight customers. In fact we are limiting the size of each product to be no more than 7-10 people. We actively discourage use of paid media till we find product market fit. 

The model is not for every idea and every founding team. This best suits ideas which have mid-size TAM, can be built at 10% of the cost it would have taken 3 years back, and are NOT winner-take-all situations.

With this in mind, we are particularly excited about reimagining the sales & marketing tools, fintech, and sports-tech. Industries where we feel AI will have the biggest impact and delightful micro-SaaS solutions can be built. 

If you’re an entrepreneur looking for the perfect tools and guidance that will drive your venture to success, let's connect & explore how we can collaborate to drive meaningful impact & foster a digitally empowered world!","Investing and Building Wonderful AI Driven Micro SaaS Business

Frequently Asked Questions

Why subscribe to your plans instead of hiring someone?

Agencies are rigid. Freelancers are executional. Design hires are too specialised in one vertical (a senior full-time designer easily costs over >120 annually).

Your an agile and iterative startup. You don’t need someone that only specialises in making pretty screens. You need an agile design leader working closely hand-in-hand with you, embedded in your startup team to collaborate with your team and iterating design across different verticals. Full-time basis.

With Formatif's design copilot,  you maximise your cost based on your design work and get access to varied expertise. Save cost savings and maximise your inestment. Work with multidisciplinary designers - holistic expertise across brand, product, design work with ex-investor and startup designers with over 5+ years of experience across brand, product, consulting and fundraising.

Is there a limit to the design requests I can make?

Add as many design requests (across any category) as you like to your queue with our collaborative dashboard. We deliver each request one-by-one, with a turnover of 2-3 days for each iteration

How does the pause feature work?

Your startup needs change, and we totally understand! Pause your subscription any time. Billing cycle is based on a 31-day period, and credits are on a rollover basis. If you use the subscription for 18 days and pause, you have 13 days remaining on your subscription that can be used at a later time. No

Who will I be working with?

Formatif is founded by Sarah, who has worked extensively with startups across in product design, consulting, investments and a strong understanding of the startup landscape.

You get holistic design leadership, and work directly with me as the main point of contact. I bring in and manage designers in my network for executing design tasks depending on the project nature.

How many clients do you work with?

We selectively partner with up to 2-3 major clients each month, focusing on those who align with our values and where we can make a significant impact. This selective approach ensures dedicated attention and exceptional quality in our collaborations.

Got a defined design project to work on?

EXTREME FAÇADE SOLUTIONS

Veraspec is proud to be recognised both Australia-wide and globally as an industry leader when it comes to glazing, cladding and fixings at extreme height in high-risk environments.

Veraspec is the culmination of three generations of pioneering glazing and facade solution experience. From humble beginnings as a family glass and glazing company based in Brisbane, Australia, Veraspec has evolved into a multi-disciplinary company with branches in New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia, and more recently Dubai.

Height Access

We are committed to delivering world-class solutions that meet at the intersection of safety, value, and structural and aesthetic integrity for peace of mind. Our team of qualified professionals is experienced in delivering innovative, site-specific solutions at height in dynamic, high-risk environments. From the highest building peak to the most complex building facade, we can reach it.

Extreme Façade Solutions

We specialise in facade defect auditing, optimisation, and remediation works involving glazing and cladding on existing high-rise buildings and other complex structures. We have an experienced team who are equipped to deliver customised solutions across glass facades, curtain walls, atrium glazing, glass roofs and beyond. We apply our expertise and experience as pioneering innovators in the sector to fabricate specialised equipment to improve safety, increase productivity, and solve seemingly impossible problems for our clients.

Facade Defect Auditing

We provide a full building façade inspections service including the provision of the Building Facade Manager (BFM), which is a digital platform designed and developed by Veraspec. It is an invaluable addition to our ever-evolving tech toolkit which allows us to audit and manage building facades. BFM generates a dynamic 3D interface so users can interact with building facades. It is especially useful when working at extreme height, as it equips us with the capacity to demonstrate the nuances of the work we are undertaking. By uploading data throughout a project, clients can see progress in real-time.

Cladding (ACP) Replacement

Across Australia, building owners and managers have been dealing with a crisis with residential and commercial high rises being found to facades containing dangerous highly combustible cladding. Veraspec is the trusted and established industry specialist in Aluminium Composite Panel (ACP) cladding replacement. As legislation and standards are subject to change, Veraspec is uniquely placed to communicate with stakeholders and ensure all activities meet or exceed compliance requirements.

Sharlene Poon, ACJC 2022 - Ryan possesses the gift of explanation. Concepts were so coherently substantiated that I pretty much had no doubts. Off the top of his mind, he was able to create analogies like no one else.

Xu Xin, HCI 2022 - Meeting Ryan was the best thing that has ever happened to my academics. Upon having lessons with him for just two months, I got an A. My progress really felt like a fever dream. After undertaking his tutelage, sleeping in my school lectures become more productive than destructive.

Ong Jee Sean, CJC 2022 - Having scored B3 for O’s, I was constrained by the fixed mindset that I was mediocre at Physics. Ryan didn’t think that way. Under him, I topped my cohort 7 times. He possessed this unique ability to bring equations to life. Being taught by him was an unfair advantage.

Meeting Ryan was the best thing that has ever happened to my academics. Upon having lessons with him for just two months, I got an A. My progress really felt like a fever dream. After undertaking his tutelage, sleeping in my school lectures become more productive than destructive. His speciality, the Testing Session, gave me extreme familiarity with the actual A's, which made me feel confident at Physics and Math. I've taken tuition from a lot of tuition centres throughout my life. Among all the “super tutors” that I've learnt from, this dude is the best.

Xu Xin

HCI 2022

I joined with an absolutely horrendous score and feared that I would fail to keep pace with the other students he taught. He was largely aware that tuition was not one-size-fits-all and devised a detailed study plan for me to catch up over the December holidays. He also checked in frequently to ensure that the workload was manageable and that I was being consistent. With this extra help, I was caught up with his stronger students within a matter of weeks. For those that are struggling with Physics, trust me, just go to Ryan. He will make your life easier.

Sharlene

ACJC 2022

Having scored B3 for O’s, I was constrained by the fixed mindset that I was mediocre at Physics. Ryan didn’t think that way. Under him, I topped my cohort 7 times. He possessed this unique ability to bring equations to life. Being taught by him was an unfair advantage. The centre was, in essence, a country club. I was allowed to study on the premises often, which was nice because I didn’t have to fight for a seat at the library anymore. Food and drinks were often provided for us, especially during mugging season, which allowed us to focus solely on our studies.

Get to know me in my full FAQ

Why are you naughty?

That's for you to find out 👄

Are you a good texter? How to reach you?

Oh baby, you can buzz me from 10am to 6pm on the daily. I may not be the fastest texter, but I promise I will not ghost you like a red flag.

My mobile:

+65 85038093

We can write love letters like the old times:

hello@naughtymonger.com

Your support system:

Monday to Sunday 10am to 6pm

xoxo

Can I pick you up? Or visit you?

I'm a busy man...lets take it slow. You can pick my fishies and catches! I'm very proud of them.

What is your favourite colour?

When I watch the sunset together with you, eating our favourite sashimi from a platter <3

What is your best and worst quality?

I am very picky about my fishies. They must reach my standard of quality to pass the naughty test. If it ain't a catch, I'm not catching it. You could say I am picky or meticulous 😉

What is your occupation?

A seafood wingman. A monger. An honest lover. Your best catch.

Do you want kids?

My pet fishie is my kid.

Okay okay I promised 100 likes and I’ll do a Christmas dance. My marketing elf is mean, we’re doing it mean girls style 😤😒😩 (anybody wants her job? asking for a friend)

How to make seafood in a bag cajun style
👇👇👇
0. Thaw your seafood platter (all except oysters) overnight in the fridge (Thaw means take out from the cooler bag and place in fridge when item is inside the vacuum plastic seal) Oysters leave it in the freezer bc not gonna use here
 1. Unsalted butter, minced garlic, lemon juice & of course cajun la
 2. Put it all together
 3. Place paper towel on the bowl
 4. Microwave for 2mins
 5. Take out all your thawed seafood 
 6. Place in a BIG bag
 7. Mix sauce, mix sauce into the bag, mix the bag of seafood
 8. And you serve 😮‍💨
 9. Now that’s how a party is done

Last few days to put in your last min Christmas orders!!! It’s the season to be naughty

Guaranteed mess and laughter. So good you might just choke but please don’t 

😙 Oyster Game 1: Take a slurp every time someone says ____.

🤬 Oyster Game 2: Who is the softest slurper without using hands____.

🤗 Oyster Game 3: Blindfold slurping.

 Oyster Game 4: Use random household objects to shuck the oysters.

We kindaaaa don’t recommend who can slurp the most for OBV reasons 😏 Eat responsibly mates unless you want +1 or more the next Christmas hehe

Got ideas? Share leh

76,ambiguous,No,Traditional desgin studio,"ambiguous is a lighting design studio driven by eco-centrism values, based in Singapore and Tokyo lead by award winning lighting designer Yusuke Hattori.

In lighting design, there is a role beyond improving the appearance of a space. Our aim is to improve the natural environment, including humans, through light and lighting. We recognize that humans are a part of nature and strongly advocate for a shift away from human-centred thinking and towards eco-centrism, or nature-centred thinking.
With this philosophy in mind, we collaborate with a diverse group of people to imagine and explore different ways of using and experiencing light as a material.„ÄÄ

Our design approach is Regenerative Lighting Design. Regenerative means creating positive impacts rather than merely minimizing negative ones, and goes beyond ""sustainable"". Applying this philosophy in the context of lighting design means taking for granted conventional lighting design approaches that reduce negative environmental and social impacts, such as energy conservation and light pollution, and creating light environments that actively contribute to the regeneration and enhancement of natural systems, social systems, and economies, including human. A comprehensive design approach is required, taking into account the interrelationships of many conditions and elements. Our Regenerative lighting design principles are integrated with all our design/ consulting services.

Our company will use light and lighting as materials to design the relationship between architecture and people, cities and nature. As collaborators, we will also be experts in exploring the ways light and lighting can and should be used.

We are always looking for new challenges and interesting collaborators.","About

82,The Legacy Project,No,Content producer,"[WHO WE ARE]

A collective of creatives who craft autobiography shorts for those who are dying or have died - through photos, film and the written word. 

[WHY WE DO THIS]

Dying is a really hard thing for everyone involved, no matter how you prepare yourself for it. 

The heartbeat of The Legacy Project is to confer honour upon the one who is passing or has passed, by telling the story of their life and the legacy that they leave behind, and to help their loved ones grief and remember the person that they are. 

Think of it as a personal ‚Äúhero story‚Äù or biography short.

We believe that every human life has deep meaning and a legacy that continues to ripple on, but sometimes these are in the unseen elements and simply requires a witness to make it seen. We want to be that witness. 

[HOW WE TELL THE STORIES]

Much like how a biography is approached, interviews will be done with the passing person and/or their close loved ones, which will then be weaved into a written story by the Storyteller. 

Sometimes the real essence of a person is unseen to themselves and those around them, and requires someone to perceive, connect the dots, and make that known. That‚Äôs what the Storytellers will do.

The written stories will be beautifully paired with pictures of them and their loved ones by the Photographers. Who and what we photograph will be dependent on their comfort level and their story, and approached with respectful sensitivity. 

The purpose of the final story is not to simply recount events, but to pull out and witness to who the person is, and the unique essence they embody - their legacy to the earth. 

[RATES]
$900 for a full story.  

Each story includes: 
- a series of at least 50 photos
- a written autobiography short of the individual of at least 20 pages
- a final edited photo story e-book
- unlimited interview sessions with the individual, family and friends",,Others,Broadcast Media Production and Distribution,the_legacy_project.vertex_invalid,https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-human-legacy-project,,Singapore,Coresignal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,0,[],,0,,,0,,,,"[{'2024-02-16 21:29:17': None}, {'2024-01-16 00:09:47': None}, {'2023-12-18 01:58:03': None}, {'2023-11-21 20:54:40': None}, {'2023-10-16 18:21:18': None}, {'2023-07-04 20:22:18': None}, {'2023-05-25 04:42:22': None}, {'2023-04-25 08:57:36': None}, {'2023-03-05 03:39:56': None}, {'2023-02-15 18:59:50': None}]",,

WHAT CLIENTS SAY

It has been an absolute pleasure to work with Richie Chan Li Qi. He had an incredible ability to listen to our needs and translate them into unique design solutions for our various properties. His attention to detail and wide range of skills was evident in his work. Richie was also always exceedingly accommodating in respect of his fees and always assisted us during financial challenges as was the case from 2020 to date in Myanmar. Richie was result- and quality-focused regardless of what fees were paid to him. We were immensely grateful to Richie for being able to retain his excellent services during this period of hardship. Richie’s exceptional professionalism in meeting deadlines and fostering clear and collaborative communication with our teams had been remarkable. The results he delivered far exceeded our expectations, and we couldn’t be happier with his work. I highly recommend Richie to anyone looking to work with a talented and all-rounded creative individual. Richie supported us at the Strand Hotel, Strand Cruise, Inya Lake Hotel and Hotel G Yangon. We will continue to work with Richie whenever there is an opportunity.

Your Destiny, With Us.

Destiny is no matter of chance. It is a matter of choice.

Destiny is no matter of chance. It is a matter of choice.

Birds enjoy their flight, because they have no boundaries, they don’t need a visa to enter a country. Whenever I look at those birds, I always wish that humans were also so free, if the world was a better place with no boundaries. In that regard, I would also like to empower my clients in a similar fashion.

There are a handful of countries around the world whose citizens benefit from their powerful passports. Acquiring citizenship or residency in these countries means you can travel visa-free to most countries in the world as they offer a better quality of life with political stability and financial security. After all, it said that our destiny is not written for us, but by us.

We at Destiny Migration Company offer our service to help you reach your goal seamlessly and be your trusted partner through every step of your journey.

The LNG environment has changed drastically over the past 10 years as LNG use has expanded, with increased complexity due to more intense competition, diversification of contract terms and price indices, increased commoditization, improved spot market liquidity, and greater market price volatility.

132,Gary's Italian Restaurant,No,,"Set in a beautiful two-storey black-and-white colonial bungalow, Gary’s is nestled amidst the verdant surrounds of Rochester Park. Chef Gary became a celebrity chef after he won over who’s who with his culinary prowess. The eponymous Gary’s captures romance in a heritage house surrounded by garden greenery. Partake from an exquisite Italian Japanese menu designed around the freshest produce. 

 

Tranquil Surroundings Where Old-World Meets Modern   

Gary’s is all about amazing food in a serene and picturesque location. Step in from the green surroundings of Rochester Drive to a beautiful juxtaposition of old-world charm and fresh trends. Cool marble flooring and counters are contrasted with warm wood panels, while classic parquet flooring is uplifted with futuristic lighting design. Whether you prefer to dine indoors or alfresco, the romantic atmosphere is matched by creatively plated dishes that are a feast for the eyes and Instagram-worthy. Whether you come to Gary’s for a dinner for two,  

or an end-of-the-week lunch with the bestie—you’ll be immersed in a whole new world that will delight your senses. 

 

A Taste of Italy with a Touch of Japanese 

The reimagining of Italian fine dining with a Japanese sensibility makes Gary’s menu a tour de force. Surprising appetizers include the Iconic Garden Salad – Giant Asparagus with Mushroom, Baby Corn, Black Olive, Cress and Mashed Potato – and Red Prawn Tartare, featuring Okra, Cherry Tomato and Wakame. A warm and welcoming classic Italian soup is the Signature Mediterranean Seafood Soup.  

 

The Pasta menu is hard to resist: Chef Gary’s Lobster Risotto that’s aged seven years is every bit as marvelous as his exotic Bamboo Clam with Squid Ink Pasta and his Carbonara featuring Iberico Chips and a pasteurized egg sauce with pasta cooked to al dente perfection. 

 

For mains, Gary’s boasts an enticing seafood menu as well as robust meat offerings.","41 Rochester Drive Singapore 138582

138,The Academic Label,No,,"The Academic Label is a youth-run mentorship initiative, for youths from all walks of life. Unique in its action-driven focus and age sensitivity, the initiative seeks to bridge inequity in the education landscape by liberalising information and experiences through its unique mentorship programme.

With the 1-to-1 youth mentorship at its core, the programme actively encourages mentees to translate the insights from their mentorship into tangible action through various supplementary programmes. The mentorship is also further enriched by life counselling services provided by its partner, International Minds, enabling even the most lost of mentees, to embark on their journey of discovering themselves.

The programme runs in 3 months cycles, during which mentees are matched to a mentor through a holistic matching process. Throughout their mentorship period, mentees have full access to all supplementary programmes of The Academic Label.

In The Academic Label's initial pilot run between December 2022 and February 2023, the programme accepted 40 over mentees and recruited 30 over mentors. Cumulatively, in the three months of the first run, mentor-mentee pairs completed over 180 hours of mentorship.

The initiative also launched the Application Support Programme, a supplementary programme aimed at guiding mentees through their tertiary education aspirations through team-based support from an incredibly diverse (and continuously growing) team of over 30 advisors representing 10 different locales. 

In upcoming runs, beyond scaling up the mentor and mentee intakes, the programme is expanding the Application Support Programme through school based partnerships. Pilots for programmes aimed at providing vocational experiences for mentees are also underway and are set to be launched in the upcoming runs.

In line with our desire for continuous growth, the initiative's mentor pool and administrative team is constantly growing and actively welcomes all motivated persons.","YOUTH MENTORSHIP

I took both basic kpop and intermediate kpop. The instructor is super approachable and friendly. The expertise is really good. Class structure is 15 mins of warm up and basic isolation elements, followed by 45 mins of chreography teaching and 15 mins of filming rehearsal. The pace is good, start with 8-beat units, then sync with 0.8x music and slowly increasing speed. Very detail orientated on when and where to exert force, which body parts to prioritise, slow break-down of movements etc. make sure every move is naturally linked and has that desired blasting effect. The vibe is also friendly, encouraging everyone to solo in a friendly way. Hope the studio opens hiphop classes too.

Went here as a beginner, wasn't sure what I was doing by myself but the people here are friendly, it is a relaxing place, and they also helped me to progress. Studio is spacious and it was comfortable for me to perform all the poses. The location is accessible from Farrer Park MRT in less than 5mins walk but could be a hassle on rainy days since there's not much shelter along the way.

Such a great dance studio for the beginner. Location is easy to reach, and close to public transportation. Classroom size is small which is so helpful for beginners. Instructors are patient and nice, making it easy to follow. Will definitely recommend anyone who like to dance.

Helping Consultants Get More Clients Through A  Personal Website

Differentiate yourself from others

Work With Us

Why Do You Need a  Personal Website  ?

In today’s time and age, people would google you before meeting you. It’s like how we search for food reviews before making the trip down.

Having a personal website allow prospects to see who you are, what you offer, and how you can help. It is also a place where you can show off your accolades and testimonials to  build your credibility.

In the sea of >20,000 professionals in Singapore, having a personal website can help you  stand out and differentiate from other consultants.  If you don’t create a strong branding and positioning for yourself, you’re leaving money on the table.

A consultant's most powerful sales tool is a website that can convert a high percentage of visitors into qualified leads.

Seekingalpha.com

Who are  we?

We are a web design company specialising in working with consultants. We understand your pain points and your desires. Most financial advisors face similar problems: insufficient leads, prospect ghosting you, or other FAs stealing your prospects. All of these hinder you from achieving your goals.

All of these issues stemmed from not having a strong enough positioning. Think about this, in the eyes of prospects, you are just another “consultant who wants to sell them something.” We help you stand out in the sea of consultants.

Our goal is to help you establish a strong branding, position and level up your credibility via a personal website.

Having an effective website is like having a 24/7 personal assistant.

It works for you while you sleep.

People can reach out to you via your website.

It increases your authority and positioning.

We want to make it easy for you to have a personal website. That is why with our studio, we take care of everything for you. Just like how clients offload their worries to you, we aim to do the same for you.

Our 3 Step Process

Discovery Call

Just like how you sit down with prospects to understand their goals and needs, that is exactly what we will be doing in this call. We will discuss what your objectives are, and how we can achieve them.

Proposal & Discussion

We will prepare a proposed sitemap to show you the possible end look of	your website. This is also where we go into a deeper discussion on building	your dream online presence. For example, your preferred colour palette.

Design & Development

Sit back, and relax while we get to work for you. We will make your vision	a reality by designing a beautiful and responsive website that can help	you in your business. We aim to give you peace of mind by taking care of	all the parts of this process.

What Our Clients Say

George has experience in working with consultants, and it shines through. Communication was easy. He knows what we are looking for and how to help us stand out. He is open to discussing the details and achieving my desired look and outcome. He provides free revisions as well, which is a plus point. The best part is that now I have a website to send to prospects which helps in building authority.

Elle

I’ve engaged George’s services twice. The first was to build my website,	and the second was to create a long-form sales funnel to take prospects	on a journey to become clients. He is a responsible guy that keeps his	word which makes the working experience pleasant. I’m satisfied with both	the websites he has built for me. George is your guy if you want to craft	a strong positioning for yourself through an online presence.

Don

George worked and delivered fast. After understanding what I wished to achieve, he gave an estimated delivery date and delivered before the date. We had a few calls to discuss what I wanted, and he was patient throughout and made my vision come to life. Now I have an online name card that I am proud to share with prospects before appointments. The number of “can we reschedule and proceed to MIA” has dropped since.

Teeth on the lower rollers swing the article 1 to the other side of the guide and it rises between rollers 48 and divergent plates 47 which remove the zinc chloride crust and guide it clear of the path of the article. Rolls 51, cleaned by brushes 91, and additional rollers 52, 53 all of which are internally cooled carry the articles to a conveyer 72 leading to a rotary cooling rack. The surface of the zinc between the upper ends of the plates 47 is freed from slag by paddles 58, 58a, Fig. 3, reciprocated by a rotary disc 68 and connecting rod 67, and also raised and lowered by cams 63, 63a.

At least the displacement of the chair seat is guided at the end opposite to the axis of pivotal attachment of the seat to the back rest along a curve so determined that, when the back rest and seat undergo a displacement between the two positions mentioned above, the center of gravity of the user&#39;s body moves away from a horizontal plane over a distance which is sufficiently short to ensure that the user can modify the relative position of the back rest and seat by exerting acceptable efforts without any need to rise from the chair.', 'priorityDate': '1982-05-19', 'citedBy': ['US-5131717-A', 'GB-2275867-A', 'US-5577802-A', 'US-7201445-B1', 'US-2007181826-A1', 'CN-102371918-A', 'GB-2472920-B', 'US-D707995-S', 'US-2014197669-A1', 'US-8955178-B2', 'US-8973996-B2', 'US-9198514-B2', 'US-9198521-B2', 'US-9241571-B2', 'US-9474375-B2', 'US-2016360887-A1', 'US-9713381-B2', 'US-9743773-B2', 'US-10004334-B2', 'GB-2504843-B', 'US-10226132-B2', 'US-10334951-B2', 'US-10405660-B2', 'US-10448742-B2', 'US-10932584-B2', 'US-10973326-B2', 'US-11395549-B2', 'US-2022312969-A1', 'US-8337900-B2', 'JP-2012020686-A', 'FR-2587888-A1', 'EP-3476254-A1', 'EP-0173372-A2', 'EP-0173372-A3', 'EP-0296578-A1', 'DE-3800756-A1', 'DE-3800754-A1', 'WO-9109554-A1', 'US-5251958-A', 'EP-0578276-A1', 'US-5366274-A', 'US-5860701-A'], 'publicationNumbers': ['IT-1167148-B', 'DE-3368501-D1', 'AT-24383-T', 'EP-0108760-B1', 'AU-550998-B2', 'FR-2527061-B1', 'US-4547017-A', 'OA-07603-A', 'DE-108760-T1', 'EP-0108760-A1', 'JP-S59500849-A', 'BR-8307365-A', 'DK-21984-D0', 'DK-21984-A', 'FI-834739-A', 'FI-834739-A0', 'NO-834685-L', 'AU-1477183-A', 'FR-2527061-A1', 'WO-8303957-A1', 'IT-8348322-D0']}]","[{'publicationDate': '2022-05-06 06:26:50', 'source': 'thegrowthist.com', 'title': 'Meta makes first Asian investment into mental wellness firm', 'url': 'https://www.thegrowthist.com/news/tech-innovation/meta-makes-first-early-stage-investment-in-apac-mental-wellness-firm-ami'}]","['Collaborative Fund', 'Wisdom Ventures', 'Meta', 'Strong Ventures', 'January Capital', 'Goodwater']","[{'name': '2022/5 SEED Round', 'month': 5, 'year': 2022, 'usdAmount': 3000000, 'roundKind': 'SEED', 'isVerified': True}, {'name': '2022/1 SEED Round', 'month': 1, 'year': 2022, 'usdAmount': 1000000, 'roundKind': 'SEED', 'isVerified': False}]",1,2,4000000,"['SEED', 'SEED']",2022.0,11,,,6,,,,"[{'2024-02-21 00:04:41': None}, {'2024-01-11 06:04:39': None}, {'2023-12-11 05:10:48': None}, {'2023-11-25 23:26:17': None}, {'2023-10-09 03:42:10': None}, {'2023-09-13 01:15:08': None}, {'2023-08-24 18:48:48': None}, {'2023-07-28 23:19:27': None}, {'2023-06-30 01:38:13': None}, {'2023-05-29 07:24:58': None}, {'2021-11-26 15:05:47': None}, {'2021-10-20 23:37:31': None}, {'2021-09-24 18:06:45': None}, {'2020-08-29 20:05:20': None}, {'2020-05-12 01:25:29': None}, {'2020-04-17 08:39:31': None}, {'2020-03-08 03:57:35': None}, {'2020-02-20 22:25:06': None}, {'2020-01-06 17:50:00': None}, {'2019-12-09 10:08:08': None}, {'2019-11-11 11:55:35': None}, {'2019-10-05 06:28:29': 16}]",,

We hope that children can experience the beauty of education through Nature and Literature.

Have you ever noticed how the wildflowers dance to the beat of the wind?

Or how the morning dew drops rest delicately on grass like diamonds?

Beauty is all around us, if we learn to slow down and take it in.

Words give us the ability to express that beauty, and to share it with others.

To the teachers at Gentle Seeds this is one of our main tenets, to cultivate the joy of learning through Nature & Literature. To notice the beauty around us, and to have the words to articulate it.

There's so much to learn and hear outdoors. And so many good stories to tell!

What inspired us to start this platform?

Digital and Tech jargon sometimes scares many of us!

We took it upon ourselves to become gurus (thought leaders) in the Digital and Tech industry.

We have created this platform to exchange thought leadership ideas. We believe every industry leader wants to contribute, guide and coach a startup or a business. However, the industry leaders don’t find time and the startups often don’t have the right connections to receive the inspiration.

Any industry leader can contribute via a thought leadership article on this platform. And it is available to any startup or business to learn from.

Time is precious and we barely manage to pen our thoughts, so we hope this will connect the experienced and the experience seekers!

Remember, the future will be hidden on the internet and the Internet+++(aka The Metaverse) We want to make Knowledge and Experience transfers easy – in just 1 click!

Our Services

Define Your Strategy

As a seasoned market data manager, my experience affords me unique insights from a customer's viewpoint, which is instrumental in tailoring a market data strategy that truly resonates with consumer needs. When conducting a strategic review for consumers, such as financial institutions or individual traders, I draw upon this expertise to scrutinize how data is procured, managed, and leveraged. This involves a detailed analysis aimed at streamlining data acquisition, optimizing costs, and enhancing the data's actionable intelligence to inform decision-making.

For vendors in the market data space, integrating the customer perspective into your strategy is critical. My hands-on experience as a market data manager enables me to identify with the customers' data consumption behaviors, preferences, and pain points. This empathetic approach is pivotal when advising vendors on how to structure their offerings. It allows for the development of nuanced data solutions that are not only customer-centric but also forward-looking, addressing unmet needs and adapting to changing market conditions.

Our strategic review service is comprehensive, taking into account these dual perspectives. For consumers, the focus is on aligning market data with business goals to enhance efficiency and analytical depth. For vendors, the strategy involves innovating around data delivery, quality assurance, and pricing structures, informed by real customer usage and expectations.

By leveraging my background in market data management, I can help you craft a strategy that not only achieves your business objectives but also elevates your position in the eyes of your customers, whether you are a vendor looking to refine your product offerings or a consumer aiming to capitalize on market data to drive profitability and growth.

Transform Your Infrastructure

Modernizing your market data distribution systems encompasses a multitude of strategic improvements. This involves migrating to cloud-based solutions which offer a myriad of benefits compared to traditional systems.

By transitioning to the cloud, you can harness the power of scalable resources that adjust to your demand, ensuring that you pay only for what you use. Moreover, cloud systems facilitate improved data management and analytics capabilities, allowing for real-time insights and decision-making. This shift also promises enhanced security features, as cloud providers typically offer robust cybersecurity measures that are continuously updated against the latest threats.

In addition to the technical advantages, moving to the cloud can lead to significant cost savings. Traditional deployed systems often come with high upfront capital expenditures for hardware and software, as well as ongoing maintenance and support costs. Cloud services, on the other hand, typically operate on a subscription-based model with predictable, recurring expenses that can be adjusted as your business needs evolve. The reduction in physical infrastructure also means savings on energy costs and space, further contributing to a lower total cost of ownership..

Overall, by modernizing your market data systems with cloud solutions, you can achieve a more agile, secure, and cost-effective data distribution infrastructure that aligns with the digital transformation goals of today's competitive business environment.

Optimise Your Costs

The global expenditure on market data is on an continual upward trajectory, 2022 set a new record of US$37.3 billion this represented an increase of 4.7% year on year. The projections for 2023 are for a similar uptick.

For most financial institutions, market data costs are typically the third-largest budget item, trailing only behind real estate and personnel expenses. Consequently, this spending category often comes under the microscope of executive leadership during cost-cutting initiatives.

Our team boasts a substantial track record in effectively reducing such expenses across both global and regional financial institutions. We offer services to streamline your expenditure on market data terminals, data feeds, and distribution systems.

We can assess your vendor contracts and pricing structures, recommending either alternative data sources or the renegotiation of existing vendor terms, always with careful consideration of the potential effects on downstream applications.

Our deep knowledge of vendor products and pricing structures along with our longstanding relationships with all the leading vendors allow us to help you achieve the best possible outcome from a cost optimisation initiative.

Be Compliant !!!

Our compliance review service meticulously evaluates your adherence to regulations and standards, ensuring that all aspects of your operations meet necessary requirements. This detailed assessment not only identifies potential risks but also strengthens your organization's compliance stance, helping you to avoid legal and financial repercussions.

We also specialize in preparing for and defending against vendor or exchange audits, which are often complex and thorough. Our team offers expert guidance to organize your records and systems pre-audit, ensuring you're fully prepared for the auditors' scrutiny. During the audit, we provide strategic advice and representation to address inquiries and minimize disruptions to your operations.

Additionally, we assist in navigating the intricate and constantly changing policies of vendors and exchanges. Our expertise in interpreting these policies helps you understand and act on the legalities and contractual obligations, ensuring ongoing compliance and preventing costly violations.

In summary, our services equip your organisation with the necessary tools and support to maintain a solid compliance framework, effectively prepare for audits, and confidently understand and adhere to vendor and exchange policies.

Educate Your People

Our comprehensive market data training program is meticulously designed to cater to both the technical skills and commercial acumen required by market data professionals. This training is essential for staff who handle the complex and dynamic nature of market data within your organization. By providing them with in-depth knowledge and practical skills, we ensure that your team is well-equipped to manage and utilize market data effectively, aligning with industry best practices and regulatory standards.

For technical staff, our training encompasses a deep dive into the architecture, systems, and tools that are pivotal in managing market data. This includes understanding the nuances of data procurement, integration, and management, as well as the technical skills needed to navigate and leverage advanced market data platforms and applications.

On the commercial side, we tailor our training to impart a thorough understanding of market data licensing, contracts, and vendor management. This knowledge is crucial for making informed decisions that affect the cost and compliance aspects of market data. Commercial staff will gain insights into negotiating contracts, managing vendor relationships, and optimizing market data spend without compromising on the quality and reliability of data.

For developers, we provide specialized training on market data compliance. This training is crucial in preventing unauthorized data usage and mitigating the risk of costly non-compliance penalties. Developers learn about the legal frameworks governing market data, the importance of adhering to licensing agreements, and the best practices for embedding compliance into the software development lifecycle. By proactively addressing these areas, we help organizations minimize their exposure to audit risks and ensure that developers are creating solutions that are compliant by design.

Ultimately, our training program is not just about imparting knowledge; it's about equipping your market data staff with the foresight and tools to navigate the complexities of market data in a way that supports your business objectives and safeguards against compliance breaches.

Trader Workspace and Projects

Our service offerings encompass comprehensive expertise in trade voice and recording systems, which are critical components in the trading environment. We have specialized knowledge in deploying and managing industry-leading systems such as IPC, BT, Cloud9, and Speakerbus. These systems are essential for traders who require reliable and efficient communication tools to execute trades and collaborate with team members and clients.

In addition to voice communication systems, we offer expertise in Trader desktop solutions, accommodating both dedicated PC setups and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) systems. Our approach is to provide traders with powerful, flexible, and secure desktop environments that support a wide range of trading applications and analytical tools. By leveraging the latest in desktop virtualization technology, we can deliver a seamless trading experience that enhances performance while maintaining security and compliance with industry standards.

Furthermore, we extend our expertise to managing large trade floor infrastructure projects. These projects can range from designing and implementing new trading floor setups to upgrading existing infrastructure. Our project management skills are critical in coordinating the complex logistics that these large-scale projects entail. We handle the full project lifecycle—from initial consultation and system design to procurement, installation, and ongoing maintenance. Our approach is meticulous and structured, ensuring that every aspect of the trade floor infrastructure is engineered to support high-stakes trading operations.

During these projects, we prioritize minimal disruption to daily trading activities, aiming for a seamless transition to the new systems. Our team works closely with IT departments, vendors, and trading personnel to ensure that all technical requirements are met. This includes network architecture, data security, redundancy systems, and user training. With our guidance, trading floors become environments where technology facilitates peak performance, allowing traders to focus on the markets without concern for the underlying infrastructure.

186,HELP-GEBIRAH,No,Not-for-profit,"Description
HELP is a not-for-profit humanitarian initiative created to support the urgent needs of civilian victims in the Russia-Ukraine war. The solutions resulting from this effort will also be helpful to civilian victims around the World caught in armed conflicts, natural and man-made disasters.

At HELP, we value every life. Driven by this belief, we strive to put the virtue of mutual responsibility into action by supporting and empowering communities in such difficult situations, to look after each other using technology to provide direct relief.

How our HELP App can help
1.   Helping Each Other
It enables immediate and direct charitable sharing of resources by the biggest donor group, individuals from the community who are in proximity, to meet critical humanitarian needs.

2.   Increases Transparency
By not totally relying on intermediaries like NGOs and aid agencies, which can be delayed and require a lot of funds to begin operating and instead, facilitating direct relief by people in proximity, a lot of waste, abuse, misuse, inefficiencies, funds and time could be reduced and reallocated to where it makes the most difference to people who need help.

3.  Direct And Immediate Relief
By capitalising on existing aid amenities, facilities and people already on-site, help can reach civilian victims faster and save lives. People on the ground are in a better position to adjust and adapt to circumstances with first hand knowledge and data intelligence from our App. They can reallocate things and change plans much quicker in a dynamic crisis situation.

3.  Realtime Data For Better Decision Making
Data from the app can help aid agencies and NGOs to better plan for what kind of aid is required, for which territories and by whom and other logistical information for operations. It can help them make important advances that create more lasting and positive change; longer lasting solutions, instead of temporary fixes.","WHY WE DO THIS

Enabling Rapid,  Enhanced, and Cost-effective Aid

Collaborative Assistance

We empower individuals within local communities to provide immediate and direct charitable aid and resource sharing, fostering a strong network of donors who are geographically close.

Data-driven Decisions in Real Time

The data generated by our application empowers aid agencies and NGOs to make informed decisions, leading to more impactful and sustainable solutions with enduring benefits.

Transparency

By minimizing dependence on intermediaries like NGOs and aid agencies, which may encounter delays and require initial funds to operate, our approach facilitates direct assistance from nearby individuals. This reduces wastage of resources and time due to misuse and inefficiencies, redirecting these vital assets toward making a significant difference for those in need.

Swift and Targeted Relief

Leveraging existing aid infrastructure and people on-site, HELP achieves rapid responsiveness, potentially saving lives. People on-the-ground have situational awareness, combined with data insights from our application. This synergy allows for quicker and more efficient aid delivery compared to remote actors. Their capacity to swiftly reallocate resources and adapt plans is particularly crucial in dynamic crisis scenarios.

Our Web3 Glossary

Instead of using high-level terminology, we’ve put together this Web3 glossary to make technical terms easy to understand for non-tech peeps who find it hard to make sense of all the wacky acronyms and slang words used in this space.

Each and every term in the glossary is explained in simple everyday language while we’ve also given you a bunch of real-life examples of how each is used. The Web3 Glossary can introduce you to the basics of Web3 and set you up to speed for bigger, greater lessons.

Myth of the

Hunters and the

Armadillo

At the beginning of time men lived in the sky. One day, as they
        were wandering around among the clouds, a group of hunters
        came across an armadillo. Since the animal had no intention
        of being caught, it ran off, followed by the hunters. It came
        to a cloud with a hole in it from which hung a rope. Without a
        moment’s hesitation, the armadillo grabbed hold of the rope and
        disappeared into the hole.

When the hunters came to the edge of the hole they stopped and
        began to discuss whether it was worth following the armadillo
        down or give up the chase. But it was impossible for them all
        to agree, so some decided to take the risk and slide after the
        armadillo while others remained behind.

They weren’t to know, but the rope actually stretched from the
        sky right down to the earth, so that those daring enough to brave
        the unknown in fact became the first men to reach the earth.
        These were the ancestors of the Kayapo people.
        The hunters who lacked the courage to go down the rope stayed
        in the sky and are still there. The evidence of their presence are
        the stars, which are the fires they light each evening.

1,024 Web3 terms make their way into the glossary 2022 EDITION, with 1,024 unique Astro Armadillos following! The glossary itself will evolve since we want to keep you up to date with all the relevant phraseology the more the Web3 space grows!

Astro Armadillos animated series

To introduce blockchain technology to a broader and younger audience, we’ve brought to life one of our Astro Armadillos and sent him on a mission – to spread the word about Web3 around the world. Our hero’s adventures and heroic feats will be fully animated and, we believe, entertaining for everyone from 5 to 65. The goal here is to introduce Web3 tech concepts such as NFTs, Metaverse, and DeFi to wider audiences and point out the importance of being a builder, not only a consumer!

The Game

Astro Armadillos Stargating is an interactive multiplayer game inspired by the most beautiful of the Kayapo myths. Choose one among 1,024 characters from the NFT collection, take part in quiz competitions to gain access to special features, acquire superpowers, and develop your knowledge around Web3 by competing with your peers!

Microlearning

We’ll dumb down complicated Web3 protocols and concepts into bite-sized, short-form units that are super easy to absorb, create heaps of friendly tutorials, and organize hackathons and community projects to give all the talented Web3 folks a chance to hangout, collaborate on projects, and earn NFTs for completing tasks.

🎙️

Web3 Podcast Network

We plan to launch an entire network of podcasts that will consist of interview and narrative-style podcasts and a series of mini podcasts that can be consumed in a single sitting. Talking to industry experts and multi-figure entrepreneurs about various Web3 matters, we strive to build a community of millions of tech-curious listeners and be a catalyst for growth in the emerging Web3 ecosystem.

Fully accredited Web3 Post-Graduate Program

Most people in the Web3 space are self-taught. It takes a lot of time, trial and error to figure out what’s working and what’s not when learning things on your own. Thus, we decided to create a 12-month university program for everyone wanting to get a globally recognized and fully accredited degree and gain all the skills needed to land Web3 jobs and start building. The best thing of all? The program is entirely compatible with full-time work and attendants will be able to choose between on-campus or online lectures.

🛍️

Merch Shop

Loving your 3D Astro Armadillos? Show them off to the world proudly! Soon, we will be releasing Astro Armadillos merch so both holders and non-holders will be able to snag their favorite pieces from our shop.

Partnerships

Our goal is to partner with other established and well-renowned brands beyond the NFT industry and Web3 that are transparently building and have proven business experience and the potential to bring more value to this space.

A Roadmap to More

Immerse yourself into our knowledge-sharing world tailored to people of different ages and backgrounds that are aspiring to become proud citizens and builders of the Web3 world and everyone else interested in learning more about the immense possibilities of blockchain technologies.

Treasure Hunt Explained

Astro Armadillos Adventures Treasure Hunt is an innovative and
          engaging way to create excitement and interaction within our
          audience while incorporating cryptocurrency rewards.

Here's an explanation of how it works:

In the video, we've carefully positioned seed phrases or hints.
          These clues are discreetly concealed and may take the form of words,
          numbers, or symbols. We've hidden them in diverse ways, incuding
          within the video's backdrop, integrated into the story, or presented
          as visual elements like QR codes.

Your mission is to discover these concealed phrases and provide your
          guesses to unlock the reward. While the challenge is undoubtedly
          demanding, we guarantee that you'll enjoy the process and gain
          valuable insights into the world of blockchain technology along the
          way.

ABOUT THE FIRM

Actions speak louder than words

In the 
Reith Lectures 2020 by former Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney  explains what we, the people, can do to combat climate change. General partner, Robin Teurlings listened to the recording during a run along an old canal in Belgium and the obviousness of it hit him. To really make a change, serious investments in climate change are needed and with his network, experience and finances he was in the perfect position to make this happen in South East Asia.

Featured as best-in-class technology in the textbook “Introduction to Circular Economy”, published under the auspices of the United Nations (UN) Environmental Programme and awarded by the Climate & Clean Air Coalition.

By incubating the biological reactions in diverse organic residues at scale, organic waste is diverted from landfills or incineration and repurposed for soil improvement - creating a truly closed-loop value chain, reducing carbon footprint converting organic waste to Topsoil and Freshwater in a commercial beneficial approach.

Terraforming at the biological ecosystems level is now a reality.

Next stop, mars.

We are on track to becoming a key certified carbon supply standard, verified by DNV and VeChain, bringing soil-based carbon sequestration into the Carbon markets that is reflective of the actual baseline. Our certified Carbon supply on the public blockchain directly represents an additional unit of soil productivity, redefining the intrinsic value of a Carbon credit.

Our roadmap also includes a bio-algorithmic Carbon token and ReFi NFT infrastructure, stay tuned.

There is a funding gap in the world which is significant for startups in emerging markets. The main reasons for the funding gap are information asymmetry, web 2.0 technology and lack of connectivity. By addressing the underlying causes of the funding gap with web 3.0 technology, investors are connected with impactful startups in emerging markets.  

Our vision is to have democratised access to funding through a scalable decentralised network. After all, the funding gap that founders of different markets and background experience (female, color) represents a failure of the system, not of the founders!
